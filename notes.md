# Project Notes

## 8/28/25
- Scraping using Reddit API, looking for gendered instances of "dude"
  - need to find subreddits with gender flairs
    - r/actuallesbians
    - r/lgbt
    - r/asklgbt
    - r/askmen
    - r/daddit
      - r/mommit
    - r/askdad
    - r/trans
      - r/mtf
      - r/ftm
      - r/asktransgender
    - r/askwomen
    - r/momforaminute
  - not flaired but gendered
    - r/blackladies
    - r/twoxchromosomes (but maybe too many men?)
    - r/adhdwomen
    - r/femalefashionadvice
    - r/malefashionadvice
  - r/findareddit
- PRAW seems to work okay for at least grabbing small amounts of data, not sure how it will scale

## 9/10/25
- it seems pushshift.io is better for searching through large amounts of data, but kinda hard to use?
  - need to be a mod to get regular access
  - can use data dumps from academictorrents, but creates a bit of an ethical landmine to use torrented data
  - might need to look into it more
- if we don't need large amounts of data, PRAW is probably fine
